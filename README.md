# Hand-Dryer-Controller-MATLAB-Stateflow-Project
This project implements a Stateflow-based control system for an automatic hand dryer, developed using MATLAB/Simulink. The goal is to model the logic that governs a hand dryer's operation based on proximity sensing (hand distance) and ambient temperature, simulating realistic user interaction and safety constraints.
